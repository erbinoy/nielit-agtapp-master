Spam is a commonly-used term that refers to unsolicited emails sent from businesses or individuals, usually seeking to gain money through selling a product or running an unscrupulous scam. Spam is also known as "junk" email. Spam messages have been plaguing the internet for years, and these <b>bulk, unsolicited emails</b> only seem to be growing in number as the internet expands.  <br><br>

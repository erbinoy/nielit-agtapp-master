    <p>You create a new presentation.Now,you should save the presentation so that you can use it later.
The save command,available from the file tab,is used to save a newly created presentation or to 
save the changes made to an existing presentation.When saving a file for the first time, you are 
prompted to enter a file name for the presentation,and you are asked in which locationyou would like
the file to be saved.</p>
<p>File Formats:

PowerPoint 2013 uses PowerPoint Presentation (.pptx) as the default file format. Additional formats include PowerPoint 97-2003 (.ppt), PowerPoint Show (.ppsx), PowerPoint Show 97-2003 (.pps), Windows Media Video (.wmv), as well as GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIF and BMP. The
PowerPoint Show is a presentation that always opens in Slide Show view rather than in Normal view.

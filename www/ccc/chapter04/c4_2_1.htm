<b>Creating a New Workbook</b><br><br> 
When we start Microsoft Excel, a new workbook opens. <br><br>
A workbook is a collection of spreadsheet pages. Each spreadsheet page is a grid made up of columns and rows. Each workbook is saved as a separate file, with extension .xls. The default file name for the first workbook is book1.xls. Each worksheet is divided into columns and rows, Columns are vertical divisions and Rows are horizontal divisions. The intersection of row and column is called Cell. The cell located at the intersection of column A and row 3 shall be referred to as A3. A worksheet has 256 columns and 65536 rows.<br><br>
The default workbook opens with 3 worksheets, named Sheet1, Sheet2 and Sheet3. The sheet names appear on tabs at the bottom of the workbook window. By clicking on the tabs you can move from sheet to sheet within a workbook. The tab of the active sheet is always bold.<br><br>

The Ms-Excel has by default menu bar and other toolbars present (as shown). <br><br>
At the top there is a Title Bar on which the file name is displayed as "Book1"<br><br>
The Standard Toolbar is required for basic operations such as open a new file, save, cut, copy, paste, sort and other basic tasks.<br><br>
The Formatting Toolbar provides us the facility to format the worksheet by using fonts,alignments,background color,text color etc.<br><br>
Additional toolbars can be activated or deactivated by right click in the blank area next to toolbars.<br><br>
Another way to activate or deactivate toolbars is to click View > Toolbars > click the appropriate toolbar to be activated or deactivated.<br><br>
<b>The Menu Bar</b><br><br>  
Menu commands are grouped into menus across the menu bar. Equivalent commands are also avaliable in shortcut menus, toolbar buttons and shortcut keys. Some commands display submenu. Submenus are indicated by "&gt;" following the command name. Submenus contain additional related commands.<br><br>

        2.5 File and Directory Management</br></font></i></b></div><hr>
        
        <font class="light"><b>Files and Folders/Directories :</b></font><br>
        <p>A computer's operating system and the programs that run on it are made up of individual files, most of which reside in directories or folders much like a filing cabinet. 
For example, most of the files associated with the Windows operating system might be found in a folder logically called Windows. Within the Windows folder are several subfolders (many of which also have subfolders) that help further categorize the files they contain. Files that don't reside in a folder or subfolder are said to be on the root of the drive. 
Think of your home filing cabinet. Perhaps you have a file folder named 'Bills' and inside that folder you have copies of individual bills you've paid. Perhaps you have even organized them using sub-dividers, so that the Bills folder is actually broken down into months or type of bills. 
Comparing that to a computer, the individual bills would be the files, the sub-dividers would be the subfolders, and the main folder 'Bills' would be a directory or folder found on the computer. 
You can browse the files and folders on your hard disk and other removable disk drives using  My Computer and File Explorer</p>

    One of the most important developments leading to the personal computer revolution was the invention of the semiconductor or <i>transistor</i> in 1948.This feat was accomplished by <b><i>John Bardeen,</i> <i>Walter Brattain,</i> and <i>William Schockley,</i></b> who were engineers working at <b>Bell Laboratories. </b>The transistor, nothing more than a solid-state electronic switch, replaced the much larger vacuum tube and consumed significantly less power in performing the tube's job. Thus a computer system built with transistor was much smaller and more efficient.</br></br>
    In <b>1959,</b> engineers at <b><i>Texas Instruments</i></b> figured out how to put more than one transistor on the same base or substrate material and connect the transistors without wires. Thus the <b><i>integrated circuit, or IC,</i></b> was born. The first IC contained only six transistors, but the Intel 80386 in many of today's systems has 280,000 transistors. ICs can be built with millions of transistors on-board.
    </br></br>
    The world's first microprocessor was the <b><i>Intel 4004</b></i>, a 4-bit microprocessor, introduced in <b><i>1971</i></b>. The successor to the 4004 chip was the <b><i>8008 </i></b> 8-bit microprocessor in <b><i>1972</i></b>.</br></br>
    In 1973, some of the first microcomputer kits based on the 8008 chip were developed. These kits were little more than demonstration tools and could not do much except blink lights. In late 1973, <b><i>Intel</i></b> introduced the <b><i>8080</i></b>  microprocessor, which was 10 times faster than the earlier 8008 chip and also could address a whopping 64KB of memory. This breakthrough was the one the personal computer was waiting for.
    </br></br>
    <b><i>IBM</i></b> introduced its first "personal computer" in <b><i>1975</i></b>. The Model 5100 had 16KB of memory and a built-in BASIC language interpreter.</p></br></br>
